    This sensor will act as a back up RTC as the supercapacitor on the WittyPi 4 Mini will not 
    maintain time while powered off for a long period. So, during transit of the sensor system this
    RTC will be utilized in place of the WittyPi which will be disconnected from the power supply.

    Upon set up of the sensor system in the field this sensor is the first one that should be used ensuring
    the time on the device is calibrated.

    https://learn.adafruit.com/adding-a-real-time-clock-to-raspberry-pi/set-rtc-time
    - we needed to use this tutorial in order to get rid of the fake-hwclock functionality that the Raspberry Pi
    has built in when ther eis no RTC... What this means is that we are then going to essentially override this 
    and implement the DS3231 sensor in its place as a reliable RTC...

        - NOTE -> Witty Pi also has RTC... so will need to detemine conflicts with that... and ensure that the wittyPi
        gets calibrated by the system. 
        - NOTE -> Witty Pi essentially needs to be same time as RTC/System because it will act as power managment and 
        ensure the start up and shutdown times...

    After setting the DS3231 to be the RTC for the Pi then we needed to anable the network time protocol
    synchronization
        - enable NTP sync
        ```sudo timedatectl set-ntp true```
        
        - update system time
        ```sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd```

        - finally check the current date
        ```date```
    
    After performing all of these steps this sensor will not be integrated into 
    the Sensor stack in the control script as it is already running in the background

        -  The current issue is that we are unable to get the correct RTC time on the pi when we want to sync
        - The solution for this is to instead utilize the GPS RTC first to write to the system time and then write the sytstem time to the WittyPi. That way we have complete accuracy...
            - we could use the other RTC but the wittypi has more robust functionality for startup and shutdown based on the datetime and ensuring the time accuracy is important
        - Do some troubleshooting in order to check the differences in the system, RTC from GPS and the wittypi RTC

    Upon initalizing this sensor when the board is booted the GPS Sensor RTC will be written to the WittyPi. This should be done by using a BashScript...

1. Create two threads... See sensors_threads script for this....

    - It is important to note that what needs to happen is first an initialization of the MultiSensor class
    - Then after that we have the two functions...
    - CURRENTLY:
        - This is the method that will likely be utilized. With this method we have update on 
        sensors every 2 seconds etc and the monitor updates are every second and we have even incorporated a delay 
        which allows for less load ont he system.... So this will be really good we have the testing down...

    - NEXT:
        - Implement strict error handling and testing of the system and all sensors. Develop
        a robust set of classes for handling errors
        - Possible use some sort of decorator method and that is what will be used for display?
